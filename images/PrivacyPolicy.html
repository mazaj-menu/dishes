    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-column, centered layout is used to present the privacy policy. This structure is standard for legal and informational documents, ensuring maximum readability and clarity without distracting interactive elements. The user flow is a simple vertical scroll. This was chosen because the primary goal is to clearly convey information, and a traditional document format is the most effective and universally understood method for this type of content. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source report is entirely textual. Therefore, the presentation relies on structured HTML (headings, paragraphs, lists) and typographic hierarchy to organize the content. Goal: Inform/Organize -> Method: Styled HTML text -> Interaction: Scroll -> Justification: This is the clearest and most standard way to present a legal document like a privacy policy, ensuring accessibility and ease of comprehension. No charts or complex visualizations are needed. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
